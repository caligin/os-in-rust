# os in rust

my attempt at [Writing an OS in Rust](https://os.phil-opp.com/multiboot-kernel/)

## requirements

assuming ubuntu16
```
make ubuntu-deps
```
this actually requires rustup and cargo to be installed but I forgot how I did it so will be added at next iteration

## build

```
make
```

## run

```
make run
```
